## Profile

Molecular biologist with more than 10 years of laboratory experience , working in a
range of projects from target genetic modification to integration of multiple omics
datasets. Thriving in multicultural and multidisciplinary environments, I have worked
in different teams, on supervision, management and training. I enjoy learning new
skills and technologies, having learned programming, including R package
development and dashboard design. I am motivated by challenges and willing to
learn and share knowledge.
